# Premise_data_challenge

A quick analysis on food prices in Ghana, collected by on-the-ground contributors from October 2014 to July 2015. This data set (not uploaded here) contains 245k rows and is part of a larger dataset maintained by Premise. 

### Installation

I submitted my project in a iPython Notebook (.ipynb) format, as well as in a corresponding .py format. For best viewing, you can see the entirety of my project via the iPython Notebook, including the output of the programmed cells and inline visualizations.

Requirements: To run the code on the iPython Notebook (the output from my running the code is already shown), you must first install Jupyter Notebook (http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).
